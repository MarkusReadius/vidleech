# Active Context: Vidleech

## Current Status
The application is now working after resolving dependency issues. The main problems were identified as missing PyQt6 and outdated yt-dlp, both of which have been addressed.

## Recent Changes
- Installed PyQt6 and its dependencies using pip
- Upgraded yt-dlp from 2025.1.26 to 2025.2.19
- Upgraded pip from 24.2 to 25.0.1
- Created Memory Bank documentation to track project context
- Updated version to 0.1.3 in all relevant files
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to automatically create releases
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow permissions to allow release creation

## Resolved Issues
The application was not starting due to missing dependencies. This has been resolved by installing and updating the required packages:
```
pip install PyQt6 yt-dlp
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Environment Details
- Windows 11 operating system
- Python 3.12 installed
- Dependencies:
  - PyQt6 6.8.1 (newly installed)
  - yt-dlp 2025.2.19 (upgraded from 2025.1.26)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub Actions to ensure the release is created successfully
2. Consider setting up Poetry for proper dependency management
3. Implement a dependency check on startup to prevent similar issues
4. Consider adding the Python Scripts directory to PATH to avoid warnings
5. Regularly update yt-dlp to maintain compatibility with video platforms

## Notes
- The application uses yt-dlp which requires regular updates to maintain compatibility with video platforms
- The current version is 0.1.3 (updated from 0.1.2)
- The application is designed to be distributed as a single executable file
- Version has been updated in:
  - pyproject.toml
  - version_info.txt
  - src/main.py
  - CHANGELOG.md
