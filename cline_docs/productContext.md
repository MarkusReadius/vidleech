# Product Context: Vidleech

## Why This Project Exists
Vidleech was created to provide a modern, user-friendly GUI application for downloading videos from various online platforms. It addresses the need for a simple, standalone tool that doesn't require technical knowledge of command-line interfaces while leveraging the powerful yt-dlp backend.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Accessibility Gap**: Makes video downloading accessible to non-technical users through a clean GUI
2. **Platform Fragmentation**: Provides a unified interface for downloading from multiple video platforms
3. **Format Complexity**: Simplifies format selection with easy-to-understand options (Best, HD, SD, Audio)
4. **Installation Complexity**: Offers a single-file Windows executable with no external dependencies
5. **Progress Visibility**: Shows real-time download progress for better user experience

## How It Should Work
1. User launches the Vidleech application
2. User pastes a video URL from a supported platform
3. User selects desired format (Best, HD, SD, Audio Only)
4. User chooses download location (defaults to ~/Downloads)
5. User clicks Download button
6. Application shows real-time progress and status
7. Upon completion, user is notified of successful download
8. Downloaded file is available in the selected location

The application should be intuitive enough that users can accomplish their goals without reading documentation, while still providing enough flexibility for different use cases.
